# CC-etiquette

This repository contains the files necessary to complete Coding Club's tutorial on coding etiquette - you can check it out at https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/04/25/etiquette.html

The data for `bad_script.R`, `good_script.R` and the tutorial were downloaded from the Living Planet Index (http://www.livingplanetindex.org/home/index).
